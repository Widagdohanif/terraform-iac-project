1. If you don't have permissions to do the following changes, contact your AWS Administrator

2. Navigate to the IAM console

3. Locate the IAM user or role that is experiencing the error

4. Edit the permissions for the user or role by adding a new inline policy

5. Create a new policy with the following content:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "ec2:DetachNetworkInterface"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:289880680575:network-interface/*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

6. Save the policy and attach it to the IAM user or role

7. Return to the EC2 console and attempt to detach the network interface again

8. If the issue persists, check if the network interface is attached to any running EC2 instances or other AWS resources

9. If attached, stop the EC2 instance or delete the resource it's attached to before attempting to detach the network interface again
